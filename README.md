#  This project demonstrates how to set up a Python environment for web scraping using Beautiful Soup and Requests.
#  It covers essential steps such as organizing the project directory, managing dependencies with a `requirements.txt` file, and using a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.


#  The project includes a sample script (`scrape_local_news.py`) that fetches and parses local news headlines from a specified URL.
#  Instructions are provided to create and activate a virtual environment, install required packages, and run the script.
